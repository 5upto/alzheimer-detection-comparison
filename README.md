This study presents a novel MRI-based deep learning approach for the accurate detection of 
Alzheimer's disease. The proposed model, leveraging CNN architecture and transfer learning, 
achieves high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, outperforming existing methods. The findings 
highlight the potential of deep learning in revolutionizing AD diagnosis and offer a promising avenue 
for future research.
